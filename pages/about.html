		<h3>Myanna "MJ" Moody: The Hand Behind the Selfies</h3>
		<p> In the year 2016, the popular social media app Snapchat was at peak popularity for communication and photo-sharing, and newly minted 'influencers' would take to the app to self-promote using the 'selfie' technique: where one takes a picture of themselves with nothing but a front-facing camera and good lighting. Under these fortunistic circumstances, MJ took her first selfies and genius was formed.</p>
		<h3> Photography and Coaching Services</h3>
		<p>While MJ is an accomplished photographer, the nature of selfies requires oneself to be both master and muse. That is why MJ offers her personal selfies for sale, but her main passion comes in custom selfie coaching. Her patented 'look up and pout' method has transformed the selfie game of hundreds of her clients. Her work has also gained notoriety on many social media sites, making her a micrscopic influencer with a big head and iPhone 11.</p> </div>
